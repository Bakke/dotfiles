## Usage

### Enable caching

If you want to use the cache, set the followings in your .zshrc:

```zsh
zstyle ':completion:*' use-cache yes
```

### Settings

Show grunt file path:

```zsh
zstyle ':completion::complete:grunt::options:' show_grunt_path yes
```

Cache expiration days (default: 7):

```zsh
zstyle ':completion::complete:grunt::options:' expire 1
```

Note that if you change the zstyle settings,
you should delete the cache file and restart zsh.

```console
$ rm ~/.zcompcache/grunt
$ exec zsh
```
